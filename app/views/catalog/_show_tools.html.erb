  # Compare with render_document_functions_partial helper, and
  # _document_functions partial. BL actually has two groups
  # of document-related tools. "document functions" by default
  # contains Bookmark functionality shown on both results and
  # item view. While "document tools" contains external export type
  # functions by default only on detail.

  #Added Bootstrap class well and 'hidden-phone' for the tools-bar
